#### 1. Focus Area : Instrumentation and Practical Skills
By this experiment we want students to understand the connections of fluorescent lamp with the help of starter and choke coil and measure power consumed in the fluorescent lamp with the help of single phase wattmeter in the single phase circuit. Also students will able to calculate the power factor of the circuit.

#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level
Description: 
There will be a tentative circuit diagram shown in the theory part of the experiment. There will be block diagram of different instruments provided in the simulation and the same will be required to be connected as per the circuit diagram shown in the theoretical part by student while performing the experiment. After completing the circuit diagram students will record the reading of wattmeter, voltmeter and Ammeter. Based on the reading students will calculate the power factor of the circuit. 
Method:
To achieve attainment of all the objectives the experiment is designed so that students can learn through performing.

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student click on the simulation tab.Student click on the simulation tab. | Simulator screen of the experiment will open up.  | To open the screen for performing the experiment.
2.| Draw the circuit diagram according to the circuit provided in the theoretical part by using the different blocks of instrument. | Circuit is drawn accordingly in the simulator.  | Circuit diagram is formed for which student have to calculate power and power factor.
3.| Switch on the circuit to observe and note the wattmeter, voltmeter and ammeter reading.  | Simulator will show the value of voltage, current and power through voltmeter, ammeter and wattmeter.  | Readings of voltmeter, ammeter and wattmeter helps in calculating power consumed by fluorescent tube and power factor of the circuit.
